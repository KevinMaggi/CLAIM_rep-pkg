Starting from [this dataset of MSA application from Rahman et al.](https://github.com/davidetaibi/Microservices_Project_List),
the repos has been filtered keeping only those with a ground truth on the microservices, i.e. those that have a list of
its microservices documented somewhere (README, wiki, other related documentation).

Being that the repos in this dataset are often used in literature as benchmark, from the remaining repos those with at 
least 10 references in literature - and at least 100 commits - have been chosen (searching with their url in google 
Scholar).
